In this project, partially-observed time series datasets are taken as coffee beans.
As you can see, there is a coffee pot in the PyPOTS logo on the left,
and the tutorials in this repo are going to show you how to use this pot (i.e. PyPOTS) to brew your
coffee beans (i.e. POTS data) into a cup of delicious coffee (i.e. what you want).

The tutorials here are for PyPOTS users to quick start their practice, not for achieving the state-of-the-art performance.
So we didn't fine tune the hyper-parameters of each models in the tutorials.
You can tune the hyper-parameters by yourself to get better performance on the tutorial dataset PhysioNet-2012 or on your own datasets.

Besides BrewPOTS, you can also find a simple and quick-start tutorial notebook on Google Colab

Enjoy it! ‚òïÔ∏è And have fun!
